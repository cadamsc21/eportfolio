This is my assesment my name is Corley Adams and I'm an undergrad at SNHU with a major in computer science with a concentration in software engineering. I've developed strong programming skills in various languages. I'm comfortable with core computer science concepts like data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.I've honed my problem-solving skills through coursework assignments and personal projects. I enjoy the challenge of breaking down complex problems and developing efficient solutions. My academic journey has fostered a love for continuous learning. I'm comfortable adapting to new technologies and embracing challenges as opportunities to expand my skillset. The artifacts within my ePortfolio are carefully chosen to showcase my diverse skillset.  They collectively demonstrate my ability to work independently and collaboratively,  apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications, and prioritize security best practices.  By exploring these artifacts, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of my capabilities and how they can benefit your team. This introduction provides a glimpse into my technical skills and the value I bring to the table.  The following sections delve deeper into the specific artifacts within the ePortfolio, showcasing the depth and breadth of my computer science knowledge. In thia Eportfolio I have three categories for my artifacts original and enhanced. For the category Software Design and Engineering project2_submission.zip is the orginal, cs405enhanced 2.zip is the enhanced artifact, and 2wk4cs499mil2cor.docx is the narrative fot it. For the catergory Algorithms and Data Structure 4-2unittest.zip is the original, test.cpp is part of the enhancement due to the size of the zip file I can't put the whole file. The narrative for this artifact is wk3cs499mil2cor2.docx. For the category Databases week 8.docx is the original, wk5cs499.docx is the enhancement artifact, and 2week8advancedcs499wk5mongodb.docx is the narrative for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                            https://youtu.be/MtrdH2AYNJE and https://youtu.be/I4pFKO3_ve4 are the code reviews
